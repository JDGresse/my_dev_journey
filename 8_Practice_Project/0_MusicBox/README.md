# Take home coding project

You have been tasked with making a game that allows a user to practice their music theory.

Please refer to the following videos:

The game is to be played in a terminal.

## The user experience

1. When the user starts the game they will be presented with 2 random notes (eg A# and Eb)
2. The user will get to guess how many semitones are between the notes. They can enter a number
3. If the user guesses correctly,  tell them they are correct and let them play the game again
4. If the user guesses incorrectly, tell them that they are incorrect and let them keep trying
5. The user should be able to "give up" at any time. When the user gives up then:
   1. display the correct answer
   2. give the user the option to start the game over again

## What do we look for

If you were working on a team of devs on a serious code base, then how would you write your code?

Please use whatever best practices you would consider to be important on a serious project.

If you were training junior developers so that they could step into a serious job oppertunity, what tools, techniques and best practices would you consider to be important? Please demonstrate those.

We encourage testing.
